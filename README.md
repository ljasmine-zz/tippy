## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] The look of the app was improved by changing font/layout and adding sliders which allow the user to have more flexibility in setting the tip percentages  
* [x] App will suggest a lunch and dinner tip percentage for those users that need more guidance
* [x] App allows users to reset the tip percentages to predefined values by clicking on the "reset" buttons in settings
* [x] Added App Icon - made by Roundicons in technology from www.flaticon.com

## Notes

Some of the challenges included getting the app to initiate with default values for the preferences, getting the app to display the tip and total in locale-specific format, getting the sliders to round up to a precision of 0.01, implementing a theme for the app, and saving the bill amount across app sessions.
