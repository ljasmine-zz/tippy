## App Walkthrough 

Basic Functionality: User should be able to enter bill amount. App will calculate the tip and total and display them in a short fade in animation. Notice that the user can slide left and right to adjust the desired tip.

When the user switches his/her region, the app will display the tip and total in the standard currency format of the locale.

The app saves the bill amount so that if the user restarts the app within 10 min, the same bill amount is displayed.
